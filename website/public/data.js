      "title": "Bakeries Now Offer \"Emotional Support Doughnuts\"",
      "article": "Local doughnut shops have introduced a new service where customers can order an \"Emotional Support Doughnut\" paired with a 10-minute consultation from an in-house therapist. The doughnuts come in flavors like \"Blueberry Bliss\" (for sadness) and \"Cinnamon Confidence\" (for Monday mornings), and the therapists are trained to listen while the customer eats. Early reviews praise the concept, though one customer reported their therapist was actually just the baker’s cousin who \"knows a lot about sprinkles.\" The trend has spread rapidly, with some locations now offering \"Doughnut Support Groups\" for people who need to talk about their lives between bites. Experts say the combination of sugar and professional advice is \"a dangerous but effective cocktail.\""

      "title": "City Declares \"No More Apologies\" Day",
      "article": "In an effort to boost morale, the mayor of Sunnyvale has officially declared the first annual \"No More Apologies\" Day, where residents are mandated to give at least three genuine compliments to strangers daily. Police have been trained to hand out \"Compliment Coupons\" as citations for those who fail to participate, though enforcement has been lighthearted so far. Early results show a 40% increase in smiles and a mysterious surge in people wearing mismatched socks \"just because they felt like it.\" Critics argue it's \"too much,\" but the city's chief happiness officer insists it's \"about time we stopped being so polite and started being nice.\" Side effects may include spontaneous hugs and an overwhelming urge to tell your barista they have \"the best hair.\""

      "title": "Scientists Create \"Reverse Hangover\" Pill",
      "article": "A team of researchers has developed \"Wide Awake\", a pill that chemically mimics the effects of sleep deprivation, allowing users to feel alert, hyper-focused, and slightly paranoid—without ever having missed a night’s rest. Marketed as \"the world’s first anti-nap,\" the drug has been tested on college students, night-shift workers, and one very confused golden retriever. Side effects include an uncontrollable urge to reorganize your fridge and a newfound ability to solve Rubik’s cubes in under a minute. The FDA is still reviewing it, but early adopters report feeling \"like a genius who hasn’t slept in a decade.\" Meanwhile, nap enthusiasts have formed a protest group called \"Snuggle Rights,\" though their arguments keep getting interrupted by people who just need to finish that one project."
